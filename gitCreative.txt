In realms of dusk where shadows blend,
Where stars their ancient tales append,
A moonlit dance on velvet night,
Each twinkling gem, a pure delight.
The whispers of the zephyrs play,
In nature's hymn, at end of day,
Through verdant fields and oceans wide,
In every heart, love's gentle guide,
Within the canvas of the skies,
A poet's dream takes flight and flies.
Rithvik Madiraju & Ethan Liu
